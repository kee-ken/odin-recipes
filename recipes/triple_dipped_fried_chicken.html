        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fried chicken batter yields the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted!
            It has been a pinic favorite in my family for years and tastes equally good served hot or cold.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>4 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
            <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> tablespoons garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
            <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cups beer, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, 
                and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 1/2 cups beer, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper
                together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.
            </li>
            <li>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water, then dip in seasoned flour mixture.</li>
            <li>Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</li>
            <li>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches.</li>
            <li>Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to  18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted
                near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
